This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### What is this repository for? ###

This is Angular2 quick start project completed, this project was created with angular 2 in eclipse based on the official angular page.
This project works as we hope but first of all you have to do the steps mentioned in the section "how do I get set up?", it can query all the records (named heroes in the project) located in a .ts file where there is an array with the records, apart from this, you can add, edit or delete records.
This project use almost all the angular 2 concepts, it uses classes, services, directives, routes, http protocol, constants and others, but it does not save information in databases or external files.
The presentation or view is nice.

### How do I get set up? ###

First of all, you have to download Node.js and npm https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node, after this, download the project from this site, I recommend you gitbash for that, open the windows or linux console and execute npm install for installing all the required dependencies and then type in the console npm start to initialize the project as you see in the image.

The above image is a different image as you are watching because I have already installed the dependencies, but they are the commands that you have to execute.

To execute this angular 2 project is not necessary to open it in any IDE, just copy the route in the console and then type npm start to run the project, immediately the website appears in your default browser.
